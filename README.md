# Capstone-Project2-level2
Open the first Capstone Project that you created in this level (the
object-oriented program for a structural engineering company called
“Poised”.)
● Enhance your program by doing the following:
○ Incorporate exception handling to your code. Your code should
include at least two try-catch blocks (Go back to the Defensive
Programming task if you’re not sure where to start).
○ Make sure all your code is properly debugged. Make sure that the
runtime and logical errors are also identified and corrected.
○ Fix the indentation and formatting of the code so that it adheres to
the guidelines provided here.
○ Make sure that all the names of variables, classes, methods, etc.
adhere to the guidelines provided here.
○ Refactor the code to improve the quality and readability of the code
in other ways highlighted in this project
